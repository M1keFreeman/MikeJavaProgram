String - Is immutable-(means we can't change the value of the String -once we initialized in the memory);
String variable name can be changed as much as you want. But when you create an object name its impossible to change/ its immutable

String Pool is basically like a list of all the object names that were ever created

Since you cannot delete/change the object name. It will go to String Pool. String Pool checks the list whenever you create an object name to see if already exists.

String str1 ="Hello";//Here we are storing constant value "Hello" into the String variable so it'll get store into the String pool memory
String str 2 =new String ("Hello")// Here we're creating object of String with the value "Hello" so it'll get stored into heap memory

String str 3 =sc.nextLine(); //Here we're trying to get value "Hello" from user using scanner class so it'll also get stored into heap memory

==>When we compare String with '==' it'll just compare location of two String

==> When we create two String variables with same constant value,java will create one value in String pool memory and both variable will points
to the same memory location because it was same value .So comparing that variable using '=='will give you true.
